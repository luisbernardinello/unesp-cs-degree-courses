## üìë Overview

This project implements a comprehensive numerical methods calculator with a graphical interface using Python and Tkinter. Developed as part of the Computational Numerical Methods course at UNESP Bauru, this implementation demonstrates fundamental concepts of numerical analysis and algorithms applied to solving mathematical problems.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Components

### 1. Linear Systems Solvers

The following methods for solving linear systems have been implemented:

- **Gauss-Jordan Method**

  - Implements Gaussian elimination with complete pivoting
  - Transforms the augmented matrix into reduced row echelon form
  - Obtains direct solution of the system

- **LU Decomposition**

  - Decomposes the coefficient matrix into triangular matrices L and U
  - Solves systems Ly = b and Ux = y sequentially
  - Allows efficient solving of multiple systems with the same coefficient matrix

- **Compact Gauss Method**

  - Optimized version of Gaussian elimination
  - Saves memory by using a single matrix during the process
  - Implements partial pivoting strategy

- **Cholesky Method**

  - Applicable to symmetric positive definite matrices
  - Decomposes matrix A in the form A = LL^T
  - Offers computational advantages for certain types of problems

- **Triangular Systems**

  - Lower triangular system solver
  - Upper triangular system solver
  - Essential building blocks for other methods

- **Iterative Methods**

  - **Jacobi Method**

    - Uses values from the previous iteration for all unknowns
    - Implements convergence criteria and stopping condition based on tolerance
    - Checks for diagonal dominance by columns

  - **Gauss-Seidel Method**
    - Uses updated values for unknowns already calculated in the iteration
    - Generally converges faster than Jacobi
    - Implements line convergence and Sassenfeld criteria

- **Determinant Calculation**
  - Implements recursive algorithm for matrix determinant computation
  - Used to verify matrix properties for other methods

### 2. Interpolation Methods

- **Newton's Interpolation**

  - Uses divided differences to construct interpolating polynomials
  - Evaluates polynomials at any point within or near the data range
  - Suitable for non-uniformly spaced data points

- **Newton-Gregory Interpolation**
  - Specialized for equally spaced data points
  - Implements forward differences approach
  - More efficient computation for uniformly distributed data

### 3. Curve Fitting

- **Linear Fit (y = a‚ÇÄ + a‚ÇÅx)**

  - Implements simple linear regression
  - Calculates regression coefficients
  - Computes coefficient of determination (R¬≤)

- **Polynomial Fit**

  - Implements polynomial regression of arbitrary degree
  - Determines optimal polynomial coefficients
  - Evaluates fit quality using R¬≤ statistic

- **Exponential Fit (y = ab^x)**
  - Implements exponential regression
  - Linearizes through logarithmic transformation
  - Provides parameter estimates and quality metrics
