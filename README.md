## üìã Overview

This repository contains projects, assignments, and materials from the courses I completed during my Computer Science degree at UNESP (S√£o Paulo State University) in Bauru. Each discipline is organized in its own directory, showcasing the practical work and knowledge acquired throughout my academic journey.

## üéì Disciplines Included

The repository currently includes the following courses:

- **Compiladores (Compilers)**: Implementation of lexical, syntactic, and semantic analyzers
- **Intelig√™ncia Artificial (Artificial Intelligence)**: ML algorithms, search techniques, and intelligent systems
- **M√©todos Num√©ricos (Numerical Methods)**: Mathematical algorithms for numerical analysis and scientific computing
- **Programa√ß√£o Orientada a Objetos (Object-Oriented Programming)**: OOP concepts, design patterns, and software development
- **Sistemas Operacionais (Operating Systems)**: Microkernel implementation and process management

## üîç Repository Structure

Each discipline is contained in its own directory with the following naming convention:

```
disciplina-[course-name]
```

For example:

- `disciplina-compiladores`
- `disciplina-inteligencia-artificial`
- `disciplina-metodos-numericos`
- `disciplina-programacao-orientada-a-objetos`
- `disciplina-sistemas-operacionais`

Each directory contains:

- Course-specific code and projects
- README with detailed explanations
- Additional resources and documentation

## üíª Highlighted Projects

### Operating Systems

Implementation of a C language microkernel project that simulates multiprogramming in MS-DOS using the Round Robin scheduling algorithm.

### Compilers

Development of lexical, syntactic, and semantic analyzers for a custom programming language.

### Artificial Intelligence

Implementation of search algorithms, machine learning models, and intelligent systems to solve various computational problems.

### Numerical Methods

Development of numerical algorithms for solving mathematical problems in scientific computing.

### Object-Oriented Programming

Creation of software applications using OOP principles, design patterns, and software engineering methodologies.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To explore any specific course:

1. Navigate to the desired course directory
2. Read the course-specific README.md for detailed information
3. Check out the source code and project files
4. Follow the instructions in each directory for compilation and execution when applicable

## üìö Academic Context

These projects were developed as part of the Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at UNESP Bauru. They represent the practical application of theoretical concepts learned throughout the program.
